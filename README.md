# Omoide
This is a concept for a website blog for sharing experiences of hardship. The source file contains all components and pages used in this project. This project uses HTML/CSS in tandem with React. 

This project was created in the course 21G.510 at MIT and is based off of experiences that were shared with me through my family, mainly my grandmother.
